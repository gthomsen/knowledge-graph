["A Large-scale Study of Representation Learning with the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04867) by Zhai, Puigcerver, and Kolesnikov (2020).

Aims to address limitations of existing computer vision datasets which had narrow focus on evaluation (e.g. only linear probes), limited diversity (e.g. [[ImageNet Dataset|ImageNet]], [[CIFAR-100 Dataset|CIFAR]], PASCAL-VOC), or did not strongly address representation quality (e.g. ELBO, or reconstruction error

Defines good representations as one that can be used on diverse, previously unseen tasks with minimal samples.
