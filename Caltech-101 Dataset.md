# Details
## General
Fei-Fei Li's first dataset. Superceded by the [Caltech 256 dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/) in 2005 though Caltech 101 is more commonly referenced.
## Samples
40-800 images per class.  Images are roughly 300x200.  Total dataset is roughly 132 MiB in size.

Dataset is heavily homogenous as every instance had its images flipped so they had the same orientation.  This results in very recognizable class averages:
