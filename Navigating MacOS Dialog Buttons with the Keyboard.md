Keyboard navigation of MacOS dialog buttons is disabled by default, but can be toggled on for *each* dialog via `Control-F7`.  Then `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` will cycle through input elements and buttons instead of just input elements.  Use `SPACE` to select a button as `ENTER` doesn't always activate the button.

The `Control-F7` shortcut may not be enabled but can be by going to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Keyboard and enabling "Change the way Tab moves focus".
