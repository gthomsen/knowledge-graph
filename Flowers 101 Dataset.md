# Details
From the VGG group in Oxford.
## Samples
Color images of flowers.  Each class has 40 to 258 samples in it. Train and validation splits have at least 10 samples of each class, while test has at least 20 samples per class.

## Labels
Classes and BiCoS segmentations that separate foreground and background.

## Classes
The official dataset has 102 classes though only 101 are referenced.  Per the [README.txt](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/README.txt) two petunia categories were merged in v1.1.
