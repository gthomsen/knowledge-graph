Mapping of words to tags that categorize parts of a sentence.  Must be done in context of a sentence so that ambiguities can be resolved.  Consider the following sentences:

1. The brown dog sleeps.
2. The sailor dogs the hatch.

In #1 "dog" is a noun, while in #2 "dog" is a verb.

Also known as grammatical tagging.
