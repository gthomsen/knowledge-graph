The HDF5 group has recently overhauled their web page which makes it difficult to find older versions of the software.  This is somewhat key as major releases (e.g. 1.8, 1.10, 1.12) have API-breaking changes requiring manual migration, or additional compilation options to emulate an older API.

The [HDF Support Portal](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Downloads) has links to each of the versions.
