# Requirements
* Portability
    What happens if the tool no longer fits my needs?  Can I move my materials?
* Consistent format
    Can I easily translate the format from one to another.  See 'Portability'.
    Can I steal content and turn it into a blog post?
* Simplicity
    Don't get in the way.
- Multiple knowledge graphs
    "public" and private information.  Stuff to upload to Github (public or private) or to keep local only.  Private server details shouldn't go to the cloud, thoughts about technology can.

# Nice to Have Features
* Version control
   Ability to roll back would be nice.  Though unclear what the synchronization points would be.
- Publishing
    How do you share content?
# Thoughts / Half-baked Needs
- Ability to export a single page.
- Ability to export the graph for public consumption.  Edit locally, export and host on a web server.

# Use Cases
## Public Knowledge Graph
### Single Editor, Publicly Available
Organized notes that are suitable for non-personal consumption (non-personal: website, study group, collaborators, etc).


### Collaborative Editing
Multiple people editing a single knowledge graph asynchronously.  Contributors on different concepts like a Wiki.

## Private Knowledge Graph
### Single Source of Truth
## Multiple Sources of Truth


## How Do you Handle?
- Split knowledge bases.  Can one knowledge base have public and private information?
    - Private repository with tags denoting public or private.  Publish process respects tags and only exports a subset.
    - Multiple vaults without interconnection.
- What is considered private?
    - Personal information (PII, security-relevant, material that shouldn't be publicly accessible)
    - Default public, tag private as needed - depends on what is dominant.
- Local files?  Images.
