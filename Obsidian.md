# Details
[Homepage](https://obsidian.md/)

Available on all desktop and mobile platforms.

Free for local, personal use.

Synchronization to cloud (which?) with versioning and end-to-end encryption is $8/month.

Publishing is $16/month.

Commercial use is $50/user/year.
# Observations
- Version control is not part of the free package.  Looks like $8/month is required
- Doesn't have most Emacs keybindings for movement, certainly not for everything else.
- Editing is reasonably smooth - highlight something and formatting/editing is done intelligently (e.g. applying brackets doesn't replace the highlighted text)
- Knowledge graphs are called Vaults.  Can have multiple vaults independent of each other.
- Desktop client that works locally: Mac OS X
- Can't drag and drop entries between Vaults.
## File Structure
Creates files in the directory specified, without additional sub-directories.  Application configuration is stored within the Vault in `/.obsidian/`.

# Shortcuts
- Search in node (Cmd-f), search the Vault (Cmd-Shift-f)

## Publishing Example

Good example of a digital garden: [Alexis Rondeau](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/)

Search bar and alphabetized node list.  Center window shows the content (with links).  Build in graph visualizaiton which drives the content view.

Content view is layered so you can explore and roll back from where you came from.
