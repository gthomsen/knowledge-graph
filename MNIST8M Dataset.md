Originally 8M deformations of the original MNIST dataset.  Accidentally deleted in 2014, though the code to create them was released.

# Details
Deformations of the original MNIST dataset.  After accidental loss of the original dataset, the authors released code to produce new deformations.  This can be used to generate more than 8 million versions, both as a standalone utility or incorporated as a library.

# Samples
8.1 million deformations of MNIST digits in 28x28 grayscale images.

# Classes
10 classes representing each of the handwritten digits from MNIST.  Equally balanced in the original dataset.
