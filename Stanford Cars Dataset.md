# Details
## General
From Fei-Fei Li's lab.

## Labels
Key features have 2D polygon coordinates as well as imputed (and presumably reviewed) 3D polygon coordinates for the underlying vehicle.

## Samples
Cars are centered and typically shot from an angle, resulting in a strong bias in the data.

## Classes
Each class has make, model, and year.
