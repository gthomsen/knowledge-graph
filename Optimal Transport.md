Optimal transport is an assignment problem with applications like:
- Mapping deserts to people with preferences
- Mapping raw materials to production facilities
- [[An Image is Worth 16x16 Words - Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale|Assigning N-dimensional vectors to K-many clusters]]

Michiel Stock has a [good explanation by example](https://michielstock.github.io/posts/2017/2017-11-5-OptimalTransport) on optimal transport works.

Figure 1 of [[Sinkhorn Distances - Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport Distances]] also explains what is going on.
