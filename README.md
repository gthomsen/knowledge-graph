# Overview

This collection of notes and documentation was acquired over many years, with
the bulk of it residing in non-Markdown form.  After coming
across [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) the relevant bits were consolidated,
extracted, and added to this repository.  While this is most likely useful to
me, there are nuggets of knowledge that were (painfully) learned that may be
useful to others.

The focus of these documents centers about writing scientific computing software
in a Linux environment, with a heavy bent towards distributed physics
simulations written in Fortran.  More recently, documentation related to
computer vision deep learning techniques and data science with Python have been
added.

# Navigating
This repository can be browsed manually, though that's overwhelming.  Importing
this into a wiki (Github, Gitlab, [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/),
etc) works, as does opening it as a Vault inside of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
