Python-based demonstration of color histograms in 2D and 3D at [tody411/ColorHistogram](https://github.com/tody411/ColorHistogram).  First glance indicates it is oriented towards camera-based images (RGB and HSV interfaces) though the underlying 3D

Looks interesting to understand the underlying structure of the data and provide insights as to what a ML model may exploit.
