Transclusion is supported in Obsidian, both for sections and blocks.  That said, [only sections are portable while blocks are Obsidian-specific](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks#Interoperability).

Transcluding a particular section is done like so:
```
![[page#section]]
```
Transcluding a block can be done like so:
```
![[filename#^hash]]
```

See the [docs](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks#Interoperability) for more information.
